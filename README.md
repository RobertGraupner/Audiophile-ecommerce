# Audiophile E-commerce

Audiophile E-commerce is an online store project built to enhance my skills in React and TypeScript. This project showcases the implementation of modern web development practices, including form handling and responsive design.

## Live Version

The application is available online at: https://audiophile-ecommerce-front-end.vercel.app/

Remember that the initial loading may take more than 30 seconds due to the limitations of the free backend hosting.

**Note:**
Due to the backend being hosted on Render's free plan, the initial loading of the live version may take more than 30 seconds. This is caused by the "spinning down" of inactive services. Subsequent interactions should be much faster. The local version runs without delays.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TailwindCSS**: CSS framework for rapid custom designs
- **react-hook-form**: Library for efficient form management in React
- **Vite**: Build tool for fast frontend application development
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript
- **React Router**: Routing library for React applications
- **JSON Server**: Lightweight backend for API prototyping and mocking

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main folders:

- `back-end` - Contains the backend server setup.
- `front-end` - Contains the React application.
